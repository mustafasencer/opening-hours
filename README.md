### üó£Ô∏è Discussion

- As an alternative the input format can be roughly structured as below:

```json
{
  "days": [
    {
      "name": "monday",
      "hours": [
        {
          "type": "open",
          "value": 60000
        },
        {
          "type": "close",
          "value": 64800
        }
      ]
    },
    ...
  ]
}
```

###### Pros:
- A more declarative approach to data representation with JSON.
- The representation of the above schema would facilitate the creation of the Pydantic models.
- Extensibility is improved as further fields can be easily added to each object.


###### Cons:
- The object is relatively more cumbersome and bigger in size.
